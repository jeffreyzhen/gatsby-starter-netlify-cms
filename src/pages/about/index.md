  description: >-
    Founders Mike Townsend and Kyle Hill watched for many years the struggles their parents went through finding, hiring and managing caregivers for their aging grandparents. Kyle's father, Anthony Hill, has been the primary caregiver for Kyle's grandmother for over a decade, while also teaching full-time as a theatre professor at The Ohio State University. In 2012, after a caregiver left his mother home alone and neglected for a full day, Anthony took an extended leave of absence so he could fix his catastrophic home care situation. These events were so disruptive that in 2013 Kyle decided to start a home care business with his long-time friend and business partner, Mike Townsend, to make home care more accessible, transparent and affordable for everyone. What started as a simple scheduling and payment app for Kyle's family has evolved into a robust home care platform that is fundamentally changing the healthcare industry. At 99-years old, Kyle's grandmother is HomeHero's longest-standing client. Today, HomeHero's mission is to promote health and wellness in the home, and help the 120 million other Americans, like Kyle's father, who are caring for a sick or elderly family member at home.

      The scariest thing for any family is that your loved one is left home alone. This is something many families deal with and it's not the way home care should be.
